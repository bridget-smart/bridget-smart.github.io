                Bridget is a Rhodes Scholar pursuing a DPhil in Mathematics at the University of Oxford, supervised by Professor Renaud Lambiotte and Professor Doyne Farmer. 
                <br><br>
                Her research is focused on developing theoretical tools grounded in information science and network science to model, characterise and assess uncertainty in complex real-world systems. 
                Bridget applies the outcomes of her research to gain meaningful insights into many systems; currently, she is working to improve prediction quality for economic models and designing better tools to measure temporal relationships in online social networks.

        <div class="projects-text">
            <p>
                Before moving to the UK, I was based at The University of Adelaide where my research focused on modelling and measuring information flows on online social networks. 
                <br><br>
                I started this research as a Westpac Future Leaders Scholar while studying for my MPhil in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. My thesis titled "Measuring and modelling information flows in real-world networks" was awarded the Dean’s Commendation for Research Thesis Excellence. 
                <br><br>
                Alongside my research, I am also passionate about working with policy and decision-makers, sharing the outcomes of my work to improve our capacity to engage in complex settings. 
                In 2021, I co-authored the Youth National Security Strategy, check it out <a href="https://strategy.ynss.org">here</a>.

                At NetSci 2024, I was an invited speaker at the YSI Focus Session where I spoke about information theoretic estimators in finance.  At the conference, I presented a recent project on capturing temporal associations from social media data.
                <br><br>
                In 2024, I attended the Complexity Global School run by Santa Fe Institute. I also attended the WINQ Program on Complex and Quantum Systems hosted by Nordita.
                <br><br>
                In 2023, I was a visiting researcher at The University of Tokyo, where I worked with Professor Ryota Kobayashi and Professor Takaaki Aoki.
