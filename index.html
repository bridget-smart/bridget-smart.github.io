                Bridget is a Rhodes Scholar pursuing a DPhil in Mathematics at the University of Oxford, supervised by Professor Renaud Lambiotte and Professor Doyne Farmer. 
                <br><br>
                Her research is focused on developing theoretical tools grounded in information science and network science to model, characterise and assess uncertainty in complex real-world systems. 
                Bridget applies the outcomes of her research to gain meaningful insights into many systems; currently, she is working to improve prediction quality for economic models and designing better tools to measure temporal relationships in online social networks.

        <div class="projects-text">
            <p>
                Before moving to the UK, I was based at The University of Adelaide where my research focused on modelling and measuring information flows on online social networks. 
                <br><br>
                I started this research as a Westpac Future Leaders Scholar while studying for my MPhil in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. My thesis titled "Measuring and modelling information flows in real-world networks" was awarded the Dean’s Commendation for Research Thesis Excellence. 
                <br><br>
                Through my research, I am passionate about working with policy and decision-makers, sharing the outcomes of my work to improve our capacity to engage in complex settings. 
                In 2021, I co-authored the Youth National Security Strategy, check it out <a href="https://strategy.ynss.org">here</a>.

                Recently, I was a visiting researcher at the Complexity & Society Lab at the Network Science Institute in NorthEastern in Boston, where I  <a href="https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/talks/bridget-smart"> spoke about my recent work</a>  on generating dynamics with memory on networks.
                <br><br>
                I was in Santa Fe for the Postdocs in Complexity Conference and a micro-working group looking at prediction markets, a project which spun out of the 2024 Complexity Global School, preprint coming soon!
                <br><br>
                In my work looking at economies and financial markets, I'm looking at how we can predict temporal signals while overcoming the bias-variance trade-off with collaborators from INET Oxford. I was an invited speaker at the YSI Focus Session at NetSci 2024 where I spoke about information theoretic estimators in finance. 
                <br><br>
                If you’re interested in my work on online social networks, you can hear me discuss mis- and dis-information <a href="https://www.therandomsample.com.au/podcast/social-media-mis-disinformation/"> on this podcast!</a> Also check out my recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13330"> preprint</a> on a more efficient method to estimate LCS for entropy estimation.
